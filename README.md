# SmartSearch
SmartSearch is a Chrome Extension that augments the vanilla ctrl+f find function by searching for the input word as well as its synonyms. For example, if you were to search for 'portray' on a webpage, it would also search for 'represent' and other synonyms in one consolidated query. I wrote it in Node.js, HTML, JavaScript/jQuery, and CSS/Bootstrap.

I wrote this extension a few years in high school when I didn't always follow strict programming conventions, so I'm working on reformatting and commenting the code.
